## Ideas

- Progress bar for generation
- Knobs file (for controlling parameters)
- Add better command line argument controls
- Multiple algorithms to determine different world features?
- Post-noise-based generation processing and feature adding
- Voronoi division for area desirability? (greater concentration of cells in more
- desirable zones)
- Add diferent visualizations based on arguments (e.g. greyscale, height-only)
